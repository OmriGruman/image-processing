# # EX4a: Vignetting
# In photography and optics, vignettingâ€‚is a reduction of an
# image's brightness or saturation toward the periphery compared
# to the image center.
#
# Mechanical vignetting (for example) occurs when light beams emanating from
# object points located off-axis are partially blocked by
# external objects such as thick or stacked filters, secondary
# lenses, and improper lens hoods. [Wikipedia]
#
# Read more about it here:

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vignetting

# https://photographylife.com/what-is-vignetting
#
# You are an algorithm engineer in a new cutting-edge camera
# startup with a new problem of automatically correct vignetting problems.
# The team wants to correct the vignetting problem no metter what other lenses
# or lens hoods the user is putting on the camera.
#
# Each time the user switches to a new setup, he needs to calibrate the camera
# by shooting a white wall (calib_im*.jpg).
# The method you came up with is using least-squares to correct the image
# from the given calibration map, by taking the beta params (least squares params)
# and applying it back to each shot image later.
